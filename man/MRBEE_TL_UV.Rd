\arguments{
\item{by}{A vector (n x 1) of the GWAS effect size of outcome.}

\item{bX}{A matrix (n x p) of the GWAS effect sizes of p exposures.}

\item{byse}{A vector (n x 1) of the GWAS effect size SE of outcome.}

\item{bXse}{A matrix (n x p) of the GWAS effect size SEs of p exposures.}

\item{Rxy}{A matrix (p+1 x p+1) of the correlation matrix of the p exposures and outcome. The first one should be the transferred linear predictor and last one should be the outcome.}

\item{LD}{The linkage disequilibrium (LD) matrix. Default is the identity matrix, assuming independent instrumental variables (IVs).}

\item{cluster.index}{A vector indicating the LD block indices each IV belongs to. The length is equal to the number of IVs, and values are the LD block indices.}

\item{theta.source}{A vector (p x 1) of the causal effect estimate learning from the source data.}

\item{theta.source.cov}{A matrix (p x p) of the covariance matrix of the causal effect estimate learning from the source data.}

\item{tauvec}{The candidate vector of tuning parameters for the MCP penalty function. Default is \code{seq(3, 30, by=3)}.}

\item{admm.rho}{When choosing \code{"IPOD"}, the tuning parameter in the nested ADMM algorithm. Default is \code{2}.}

\item{ebic.delta}{A scale of tuning parameter of causal effect estimate in extended BIC. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{ebic.gamma}{A scale of tuning parameter of horizontal pleiotropy in extended BIC. Default is \code{2}.}

\item{transfer.coef}{A scale of transfer.coef of theta.source to theta.target. Default is \code{1}.}

\item{susie.iter}{A scale of the maximum number of iterations used in SuSiE. Default is \code{200}.}

\item{pip.thres}{A scale of PIP theshold for calibyating causality used in SuSiE. Default is \code{0.3}.}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations for causal effect estimation. Default is \code{50}.}

\item{max.eps}{Tolerance for stopping criteria. Default is \code{1e-4}.}

\item{reliability.thres}{A scale of threshold for the minimum value of the reliability ratio. If the original reliability ratio is less than this threshold, only part of the estimation error is removed so that the working reliability ratio equals this threshold. Default is \code{0.8}.}

\item{sampling.time}{A scale of number of subsampling in estimating the standard error. Default is \code{100}.}

\item{sampling.iter}{A scale of iteration in subsampling in estimating the standard error. Default is \code{10}.}

\item{ldsc}{A vector (n x 1) of the LDSCs of the IVs.}

\item{gcov}{A matrix (2 x 2) of the per-snp genetic covariance matrix of the p exposures and outcome. The last one should be the outcome.}

\item{prob.shrinkage}{Exponent for power-law scaling of selection probabilities based on Effective Sample Size (ESS). Controls the balance between favoring information-rich blocks and ensuring diversity. A value of 1 implies probability proportional to ESS; 0 implies uniform probability; 0.5 (default) uses square-root weighting to dampen the dominance of large blocks.}

\value{
A list containing the estimated causal effect, its covariance, and pleiotropy.
}
\description{
This function estimates the non-transferable causal effect using a bias-correction estimating equation in a univariable MR model, considering potential pleiotropy and measurement errors, and using SuSiE to select the non-transferable causal effect.
