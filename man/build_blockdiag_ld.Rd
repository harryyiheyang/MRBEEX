\title{Build block-diagonal LD matrix by SNP clustering with shrinkage}
\usage{
build_blockdiag_ld(
  SNP_DF,
  window_size = 1500000,
  R,
  shrink_grid = cbind(c(50, 10), c(0.05, 0.01))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{SNP_DF}{data.frame with columns: SNP, CHR, BP, P.}

\item{window_size}{numeric, window (bp) used to define independent SNP centers (default 1.5e6).}

\item{R}{numeric LD/correlation matrix; row/colnames must be SNP IDs; square.}

\item{shrink_grid}{numeric matrix with 2 columns:
- col 1: size cutoffs (e.g., c(50, 10))
- col 2: shrinkage values s in [0,1] (e.g., c(0.05, 0.01))
The matrix is internally sorted by col 1 (descending).
After sorting, col 2 must be nonincreasing (largest cutoff gets >= shrink of the next).
If no rule matches a block, s=0 is used.}
}
\value{
list with:
  - R1: sparse block-diagonal matrix (Matrix::dgCMatrix)
  - cluster.index: data.frame with SNP, CHR, BP, cluster
}
