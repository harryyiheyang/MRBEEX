\item{m}{The number of instrumental variables (IVs).}

\item{Rbb}{An (pxp) correlation matrix of genetic effects.}

\item{non.zero.frac}{An (px1) vector with all entries in (0,1]; each entry is the probability of deltaj such that betaj=betaj'*deltaj.}

\item{UHP.frac}{A number indicating the fraction of IVs affected by UHP.}

\item{CHP.frac}{A number indicating the fraction of IVs affected by CHP.}

\item{UHP.var}{A number indicating the variance attributed to UHP.}

}
\value{
A list containing simulated GWAS effect sizes for exposures (bX), their standard errors (bXse),
        the GWAS effect size for the outcome (by), its standard error (byse), the pleiotropy effects (pleiotropy), and the true effects.
}
\description{
This function generates simulated data for Mendelian Randomization (MR) analysis,
considering genetic effects, estimation errors, and horizontal pleiotropy.
It allows for different distributions of genetic effects and pleiotropy,
and accommodates both independent and correlated instrumental variables (IVs).
